        <h1>BTC.PK</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority or government. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who developed the first blockchain database, the technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of nodes around the world. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and then recorded in a decentralized public ledger.

Bitcoin is often referred to as a cryptocurrency because it uses encryption techniques to control the creation of new units and to verify transactions. The total number of bitcoins that will ever be created is limited to 21 million, which is expected to be reached in the year 2140.</p>
